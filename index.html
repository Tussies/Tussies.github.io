<h1 class="title"> Hi, I'm Atosa.</h1>
<p class="text"> I'm a second year Software Engineering student studying at Chalmers University of Technology and currently a summer intern at Volvo Group. Sometimes I create art too. Mostly though, I clown online about what the next Taylor Swift re-recorded album might be.
